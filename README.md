## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of SolidWorks designs and projects I've worked on over time. Each project demonstrates different mechanical design concepts and showcases my skills in CAD modeling, assembly creation, and mechanical prototyping. This portfolio serves as a personal archive of my work and a resource for those interested in mechanical design.

## About the Repository

This repository is a curated collection of SolidWorks models and assemblies organized into individual project folders. Each folder contains:

  - CAD Files: SolidWorks part files (.SLDPRT) and assembly files (.SLDASM).

  - Rendered Images: High-quality images or screenshots of the designs.

  - PDF Drawings: Technical drawings for manufacturing or presentation purposes.

  - README.md (per project): A brief description of the project, including design goals, challenges, and outcomes.
